### Howdy!

<br>

Fancy seeing you in this page. Wasn't really sure what to put down here but I guess this is a good start at what I'm currently working on.

<br>

I've started working on this website last year at around July, so basically at the end of my second year. I've never been much of a web developer so everything you see right now is basically me experimenting with Astro! So far, nothing has broken <i>yet</i> but can't wait to go through the pain to try and fix it. Only for it to be me forgetting to uncommenting something. Then again, the only experience I ever had in terms of creating a website would be the Team Project.

<br>

But enough of me yammering of the past, this is a chance for me to try something new! I'll try my best to keep this page up to date with current projects but this might be collecting dust every once in a while. :)
