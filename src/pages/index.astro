			<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
			<br>
			<p>My name is <strong>Jhundon De Leon Mendi</strong> (Online alias: '<strong><en>Ender</en></strong>'), studying at the 
				<a class="link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Univeristy of Birmingham</a>, 
				in my final year in <a class="link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/computer-science/computer-science.aspx" target="_blank">BSc Computer Science</a>. After this year, I'll be continuing my studies within the university as a student in <a class="link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/taught/psych/cognitive-neuroimaging-data-sci" target="_blank">MSc Cognitive Neuroimaging and Data Science (Compututional Pathway)</a></a> </p>

				I am an inspiring Extended Reality (XR) Researcher hoping to look into using Virtual Reality to affect human cognition and therefore influence actions taken to complete a task.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				For my Final Year Project (FYP), I look at evaluating the usage of the <strong>Pupil Core</strong> with HTC Vive Binocular Addon using the <a class="link" href="https://github.com/pupil-labs/hmd-eyes/tree/master">`hmd-eyes`</a> Unity Package developed by <a class="link" href="https://pupil-labs.com/">Pupil Labs</a> to determine its use in Virtual Reality via Time-To-Contact (TTC) Estimation and performance testing.
			</p>

				I've created this website as a second attempt to creating something where I can put stuff I've done throughout my academics as well as interests that pops up! This site is written using <a class="link" href="https://astro.new/">Astro</a> and using the skills learnt throughout my course.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I'm more than happy to hear ways to improve! :)</p>
