			<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
			<p>My name is <strong>Jhundon De Leon Mendi</strong> (Online alias: '<strong><en>Ender</en></strong>'), Currently an upcoming final year at <a class="link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Univeristy of Birmingham</a>, studying <a class="link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/computer-science/computer-science.aspx" target="_blank">BSc Computer Science</a>.</p>
			<p>I've created this website as a second attempt to creating something where I can put stuff I've done throughout my academics as well as interests that pops up! This site is written using <a class="link" href="https://astro.new/">Astro</a> and using the skills learnt throughout my course.</p>
			<p>I'm more than happy to hear ways to improve! :)</p>
